#Create a class called TheaterTicket. TheaterTicket
#should have two attributes (instance variables): section
and matinee. Make sure teh variable names match those
words. section will be a string; matinee will be a boolean.

TheaterTicket should have a constructor with two required 
paramters, one for each of those attributes (section and matinee in that order).

TheaterTicket should also haev a method called
get_ticket_price. get_ticket_price should have one 
additional perameter (other than self): quantity, an 
integer representing the number of tickets between 1 and
10.

get_ticket_price should return the price of the tickets
represented by the instance. The price is determined by first
by section:

-If section is 'floor', the price is 200.
-If section is 'orchestra', the price is 100.
-If section is 'mezzanine', the price is 60.
-If section is 'gallery', the price is 30.

The section price is then multiplied by the number of tickets.
Then, if matinee is true, $20 per ticket is deducted from
the final cost. The price should be returned as an integer.

For example:
test_ticket=TheaterTicket ('floor', True)
print (test_ticket.get_ticket_price(5))->900

A floor ticket is $200. There are 5 tickets, for a total 
of $1000. The show is a matinee, so $20 per ticket is 
deducted, and $1000 - ($20*5)=$900. So, the method
returns 900.

HINT: Quantity is NOT an attribute of the object; it is 
an argument only passed into the get_ticket_price method.

Write your class here!





The code below will test your class. If it works it
should print floor, True, and 900.
test_ticket=TheaterTicket('floor', True)
print(test_ticket.section)
print(test_ticket.matinee)
print(test_ticket.get_ticket_price(5))
